# Homework: great job!

1. assert statement tests
2. adding the file to your code repository
3. using the code on Colab

# Statistics: distribution/dispersion/correlation!

1. Finding the center 
2. FInding outliers
3. Getting the shape
4. Quantifying relationships


---
# Finding the center

1. mean() `the average value`
2. median() `the middle-most value`
3. mode() `most common values`

# Correlation?

A longer index finger compared to your ring finger is considered a *high 2D:4D ratio.*

1. Individuals with a lower 2D:4D ratio tend to be more aggressive [^1]
2. Men with lower 2D:4D ratios are nicer to women [^2]
3. Men with lower 2D:4D digit ratios tend to marry younger [^3]
4. High 2D:4D digit ratios correlate with poker hand rank [^4]

# Measuring significance: P Values
^ https://geographyfieldwork.com/SpearmansRankCalculator.html

- P-value is a number between 0 and 1
- P values are expressed as decimals...
- P-values are determined by the observed correlation and the sample size.
- Small p-values are strong evidence.
- With a small p-value, we reject the null hypothesis H0.

# [Giving Science the Finger](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2021-067849)

^ To explore whether random chance, weak research methodology, or inappropriate reporting can lead to claims of statistically significant (yet, biologically meaningless) biomarker associations, using as a model the relation between a common surrogate of prenatal testosterone exposure, second-to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D), and a random indicator of good luck.

# Questions

1. Are long index fingers lucky in all things?
2. Do high D2:D4 ratios cause luck?
3. Can you think of an experiment to disprove these theories?

# Wednesday: Flipping coins

Prof. leaves the room you split up into two teams. One team flips a coin 100 times, the other simulates flipping the coin. Both teams record their results on the white board without identifying which is which. Prof. returns and identifies the real flips. How does he do it?

# Probability vs. Statistics

This exercise illustrates a relationship between probability and statistics. Probability tells you that if you flip a (fair) coin often enough that you will get an even number of heads and tails. But, it says nothing about the order in which these results occur.
