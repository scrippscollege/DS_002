1. can't see down
2. look up to guess the steepest way down


^ the path taken down the mountain represents the sequence of parameter settings that the algorithm will explore. The steepness of the hill represents the slope of the error surface at that point. The instrument used to measure steepness is differentiation (the slope of the error surface can be calculated by taking the derivative of the squared error function at that point). The direction they choose to travel in aligns with the gradient of the error surface at that point. The amount of time they travel before taking another measurement is the step size.

1. How do you determine the steepest slope? (calculate slope)
2. What direction do you go? (gradient of the surface)
2. How far do you go down before looking up again? (~ Step size)
