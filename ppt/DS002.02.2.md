# But first, Presentation sign up form!

![right](https://www.evernote.com/l/ADOUVZFCThRN85wM_5db_4D_uyWRbnLJBl4B/image.png)

**Sign up for a presentation here**: [https://forms.gle/AyEUcQ5yJRXJWvCe6](https://forms.gle/AyEUcQ5yJRXJWvCe6)

Use this form to select a date and topic to make a 5-10 minute presentation to the class. You may work alone or in teams of less than 4.

**Example**: on 02/27 you might tell us why we will want to use SciPy's statistical functions instead of writing our own. What advantages does SciPy offer: speed? convenience? interoperability? all three? Then you might show examples in a Deepnote notebook.
