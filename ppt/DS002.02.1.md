1. In-person classes
2. Attendance: double the number of classes you may miss
3. Computers
4. Recordings ok?

Sharing code is hard, especially for people in the back of the room. Last year students had trouble hearing me over the room fans. I want to try using Zoom in the classroom to share my screen to address these problems. I will also use Zoom to record lectures in case you can't come to class. Good?

# Remote questions

I like to walk around the room to help you during exercises and lab time, and so probably can't handle remote questions or help synchronously.

# Copy [this data](https://gist.github.com/douglasgoodwin/22f62697025c3a5db7b6da85d32b4920) to `introduction.py`

## This data came from the form you filled out last week. 

```python
schools = ["Pomona","Scripps","Scripps","Scripps","CMC","Scripps",
    "Scripps","Scripps","Pitzer","Pitzer","Scripps","Scripps",
    "Pomona","Pomona","Scripps","Pitzer","Scripps","Pomona",
    "Pomona","Scripps"]
```

# Cycle your notebook, re-import your repository, import your new data

Can you print `intro.schools` ? Great!

# Very important Python features for DS

1. Lists `myList = ['Hi','there!']`
2. Dictionaries `myDictionary = {'firstWord': 'Hi', 'secondWord': 'there!'}`
3. looping `for w in myList: print(w)
4. functions:

```python
def sayHi(myName='Anonymous'):
	print('Hi! My name is %s', myName)
	
>>> sayHi('Doug')
Hi! My name is %s Doug
```
