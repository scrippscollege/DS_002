# Linear algebra tricks

A benefit of representing data as vectors is leveraging linear algebra to find patterns and relationships within the data.

# observations

1. similar vectors will have smaller angle between them i.e their orientation will be close to each other. 
2. The similarity between angles in this representation is captured in the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. 
3. Calculate the cosine similarity using the **dot product** of 2 vectors.
